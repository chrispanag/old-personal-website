## Speech and Workshop about Chatbots in Xanthi
*March 2018*

In Xanthi, I conducted in cooperation with [EESTEC LC Xanthi](http://eestec.ee.duth.gr/), a two-day workshop about chatbots to 12 software engineering students. Before the workshop, I delivered a speech about the state of the chatbot technology nowadays and what is happening in Greece around it.
