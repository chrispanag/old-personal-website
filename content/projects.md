### Athens Bus Chatbot
**Πότε έρχεται το λεωφορείο μου;**

A Facebook Chatbot helping over 50.000 people per week, in Athens, Greece with their daily commute.

It was the first Greek chatbot and it's now the biggest in terms of usage and unique user count in Greece.

Check out more on [the Facebook page](https://facebook.com/athensbus), or [talk to it](https://m.me/athensbus) directly (only in greek for now 😢).
